# Introduction :
In this project, we will make Temperature Conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit & Kelvin using HTML CSS & JavaScript. The Temperature is generally measured in terms of unit degree., i.e. in degree centigrade, in degrees, Fahrenheit & Kelvin.
  1. Celsius is a standard unit of temperature on the Celsius scale, & is represented by the °C symbol.
  2. Fahrenheit uses the degree Fahrenheit as the unit & is represented with the °F symbol.
  3. Kelvin is an internationally recognized standard for scientific temperature measurement. It is an absolute temperature scale that is obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by −273.15°, in order to coincide the absolute zero to 0K.
 # Approach:
    1. Create one container in which all the elements are present.
    2. Inside this container add 3 input fields in which one for Celsius and another for Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
    3. Now Style which you want I add this container in the center.
    4. Now added Javascript which converts the following Temperature(Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin) to the corresponding Remaining Two Temperature prints results in the various input fields
